<h2><a class="anchor" id="overview"></a> Overview</h2>

This project focuses on analysing employee performance and retention patterns within an organisation. By leveraging HR data, the goal is to identify key factors influencing employee productivity, performance, and retention, and provide actionable insights for improving workforce efficiency, reducing turnover, and fostering a positive work environment. The project will employ data analysis techniques, including exploratory data analysis (EDA), trend analysis, and visualisation to help HR managers make data-driven decisions for workforce management. 

<h2><a class = "anchor" id="business-problem"></a>Business Problem</h2>

The objective of this project is to analyse HR data to assess employee performance, identify trends influencing retention, and provide recommendations for improving employee productivity and reducing turnover.

Specifically, the project aims to: 

● Identify performance patterns based on factors such as age, education, department, and training. 

● Examine retention trends based on employee characteristics such as tenure, performance ratings, and awards. 

● Provide recommendations for improving employee engagement and retention strategies by analysing the relationship between key employee metrics.

Employees with higher training scores and KPI achievement show longer retention 

Award-winning employees consistently outperform peers 

Mid-career age groups (30–40) show the highest retention 

Certain departments have shorter service lengths, indicating engagement gaps 

Employees with lower previous year ratings are more likely to exit early
