<h2><a class="anchor" id="overview"></a> Overview</h2>

This project focuses on analysing employee performance and retention patterns within an organisation. By leveraging HR data, the goal is to identify key factors influencing employee productivity, performance, and retention, and provide actionable insights for improving workforce efficiency, reducing turnover, and fostering a positive work environment. The project will employ data analysis techniques, including exploratory data analysis (EDA), trend analysis, and visualisation to help HR managers make data-driven decisions for workforce management. 

<h2><a class = "anchor" id="business-problem"></a>Business Problem</h2>

The objective of this project is to analyse HR data to assess employee performance, identify trends influencing retention, and provide recommendations for improving employee productivity and reducing turnover.

Specifically, the project aims to: 

● Identify performance patterns based on factors such as age, education, department, and training. 

● Examine retention trends based on employee characteristics such as tenure, performance ratings, and awards. 

● Provide recommendations for improving employee engagement and retention strategies by analysing the relationship between key employee metrics.

**Key Metrics Analysis: Analyse key performance and retention metrics such as length of service, average training score, awards won, previous year ratings, and KPIs met.**

**Retention Trends Analysis: Assess retention trends based on age, education, department, and training.**

**Predictive Insights: Based on the analysis, provide actionable recommendations to HR for improving employee retention and performance management strategies.**

<h2><a class= "#key-findings"></a>\Key Findings</h2>

- Employees with higher training scores and KPI achievement show longer retention 

- Award-winning employees consistently outperform peers 

- Mid-career age groups (30–40) show the highest retention 

- Certain departments have shorter service lengths, indicating engagement gaps 

- Employees with lower previous year ratings are more likely to exit early

<h2><a class= "#final-recommendations"></a>Final HR Recommendations</h2>

1. Increase targeted training programs for low-performing departments. 

2. Introduce recognition programs to improve motivation and retention. 

3. Focus retention strategies on early-career employees (20–30 age group). 

4. Use KPI performance as an early indicator for engagement interventions. 

5. Invest in continuous learning for employees with high potential but low ratings.
